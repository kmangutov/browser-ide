## Project Structure
- Use a monorepo layout: `apps/`, `scripts/`, `packages/`
- `apps/playground/`: HTML/JS static site with Pyodide + scikit-learn
- `apps/site/`: Astro-based blog/docs (MDX, narrative, clean aesthetics)

## GitHub Pages
- Preserve compatibility with GitHub Pages (serve from root or `/docs` folder)
- Avoid breaking relative paths in HTML/JS

## Code Style
- Keep HTML/JS minimal and readable
- Use semantic HTML and accessible nav elements
- Organize CSS cleanly; favor utility classes if Astro adds Tailwind later

## JS/Markdown Embeds
- Support interactive JS snippets (for playground + blog MDX)
- Prioritize narrative-first, textbook-style presentation

## Iterative Workflow
- Make small, reversible changes
- Ensure playground and blog remains functional at every step
- Add blog/docs features incrementally
