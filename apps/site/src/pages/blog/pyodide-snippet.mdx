# Running scikit-learn in the browser

Machine learning typically requires a Python environment with libraries like scikit-learn installed. But what if you could run this code directly in your browser? That's exactly what [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) enables by bringing Python to WebAssembly.

## How it works

Pyodide is a Python interpreter compiled to WebAssembly, allowing Python to run directly in the browser. When combined with scientific libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn, it enables running machine learning algorithms without a server.

### Benefits:

- No installation required
- No server-side processing
- Secure execution in browser sandbox
- Accessible from any device with a modern browser

## Example: Linear Regression with scikit-learn

Below is a simple example using scikit-learn to perform linear regression on synthetic data:

<PyodideEmbed code={`# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
import numpy as np

try:
    # Generate synthetic data
    np.random.seed(42)
    X = np.random.rand(100, 4) * 10  # 100 samples, 4 features
    y = 2 + 3 * X[:, 0] + 1.5 * X[:, 1] - 0.5 * X[:, 2] + 0.2 * X[:, 3] + np.random.randn(100) * 2

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Create and train the model
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Calculate metrics
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

    # Print results
    print(f"Model: Linear Regression")
    print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse:.4f}")
    print(f"R² Score: {r2:.4f}")
    print(f"Coefficients: {model.coef_}")
    print(f"Intercept: {model.intercept_}")

    # Create a results dictionary to return - convert all NumPy arrays to lists
    result = {
        "model_type": "LinearRegression",
        "mse": float(mse),
        "r2": float(r2),
        "coefficients": model.coef_.tolist(),
        "intercept": float(model.intercept_),
        "y_test": y_test.tolist(),
        "y_pred": y_pred.tolist()
    }

    # This dictionary will be converted to JSON-friendly format automatically
    result
except Exception as e:
    # Return error information if something goes wrong
    {"error": str(e)}`} />

## How the code works

This example demonstrates several key concepts:

1. **Data Generation**: Creating synthetic data with known relationships
2. **Data Preparation**: Splitting the data into training and testing sets
3. **Model Creation**: Initializing a LinearRegression model
4. **Model Training**: Fitting the model to our training data
5. **Prediction**: Using the trained model to make predictions
6. **Evaluation**: Calculating metrics to assess model performance

## Try it yourself

You can modify the code above to experiment with:

- Different data generation (change coefficients or add nonlinear terms)
- Different models (try `RandomForestRegressor` or `SVR`)
- Different hyperparameters or feature sets

## Technical considerations

While Pyodide is impressive, there are some limitations:

- **Initial load time**: The first load downloads Python and libraries (~10-20MB)
- **Memory constraints**: Browser memory limits complex computations
- **Performance**: Native Python is generally faster for intensive tasks
- **Library support**: Not all Python libraries work in the browser (for example, visualization libraries and file I/O operations may have limitations)

For production applications with large datasets, a server-based approach is recommended. However, for learning, experimentation, and demonstrations, browser-based ML is incredibly powerful and accessible.
