# Train/Test Split: The Scientific Method for Machine Learning

## To test our faith in generalization, we must withhold what we know
Like a scientist formulating a hypothesis and then testing it against new observations, a machine learning model must be evaluated on data it hasn't seen during training. This is the principle behind train/test splitting: dividing our data into a portion for training and a separate portion for evaluation.

## Shows how to measure learning, not just memory
When we evaluate our model on the test set, we're asking: "Did you learn meaningful patterns, or did you just memorize the examples I showed you?" A model that performs well on both training and testing data demonstrates that it has captured generalizable knowledge about the problem domain.

## Sets the stage for evaluating not just how, but how well
Beyond simply asking if a model can generalize, the train/test paradigm allows us to compare different models and techniques quantitatively. This framework gives us a principled way to determine which approach works better for a given problem, laying the foundation for scientific progress in machine learning.

But what exactly should we measure on our test set? The choice of metric fundamentally shapes what our model optimizes for, which brings us to our next topic: **Precision vs Recall**.
