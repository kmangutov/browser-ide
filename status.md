# Project Status

## Completed
- Created monorepo structure (`apps/playground/` and `apps/site/`)
- Moved static Pyodide files to `apps/playground/`
- Added navigation bar to playground
- Styled navigation component
- Set up basic Astro blog
- Created PyodideEmbed component for interactive examples
- Created three blog posts:
  - Running scikit-learn in the browser
  - Using Manim to Visualize Algorithms
  - Narrative-Driven ML Curriculum
- Updated README.md with monorepo structure explanation
- Ensured GitHub Pages compatibility
- Fixed Pyodide I/O errors by:
  - Matching the playground's exact loading approach
  - Avoiding built-in datasets that require file access
  - Using synthetic data generation instead
  - Properly handling errors in the browser environment
- Fixed Python indentation error by removing problematic code wrapper
- Improved NumPy array serialization:
  - Added explicit `.tolist()` conversion for all NumPy arrays
  - Added try/except error handling in Python code
  - Enhanced error display in the PyodideEmbed component

## Next Steps
- Install dependencies and test Astro development server
- Test building the Astro site to the `/docs` directory
- Add more blog content over time
- Consider adding a build script to consolidate playground and blog for deployment
